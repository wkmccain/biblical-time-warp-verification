# Discussion & Next Steps

## What this shows
- The historical event intensity derived from the biblical corpus exhibits a **non‑linear temporal structure** consistent with an **approach/contact/aftershock** pattern centered in the early first century.
- A simple linear pulse at 33 CE correlates with the residual series; **a warped‑time pulse correlates more strongly and significantly**.

## Why this is new
- It operationalizes a long‑standing theological intuition (acceleration of sacred history) as a **testable, falsifiable model** with permutation statistics.
- It uses **non‑linear time mapping** rather than re‑dating events or special pleading.

## What it does *not* claim
- It does not identify a physical mechanism or prove metaphysical causation.
- It does not claim Daniel’s numbers are literal schedules; rather, their **wave‑like contact structure** aligns with the measured intensity.

## Robustness still to add
- Blocked cross‑validation with re‑fit per fold (coarse implementation available).  
- Negative controls: Roman annals, Han chronicles (should **not** show the same warp advantage).  
- External proxies: eclipse density (Levant), Δ¹⁴C/¹⁰Be (cosmic ray flux), comet/auroral records.

## How reviewers can break it
- Change the residual construction (alternative expectations) and see if the warp advantage remains.
- Re‑bin the timeline, shuffle endpoints, and test stability.
- Replace Gaussian with skew‑normal in τ to test asymmetry explicitly.
