# Repository Correction Note (November 18, 2025)

A previous commit accidentally overwrote the preregistered output files with test/inflated values (warp r â‰ˆ 0.958).

This has been fixed. The correct, authenticated preregistered results are:

- Warp (fixed tâ˜… = 33 CE): r â‰ˆ 0.768
- Linear best: r â‰ˆ 0.693â€“0.73
- Free-search maximum: exactly 33 CE (r â‰ˆ 0.768)

These match the official preregistered analysis on OSF:
